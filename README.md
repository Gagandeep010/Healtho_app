# Healtho

This project aims to develop a Physical & Mental Well-being Platform that integrates personalized workout plans, mindfulness practices, and productivity-enhancing techniques to promote a healthier lifestyle. The platform is designed for fitness enthusiasts and individuals looking to enhance their mental well-being while maintaining motivation through a streak-based rewards system.
Key features include customized fitness routines, guided meditation and breathing exercises, science-backed productivity strategies (such as Pomodoro and Eisenhower Matrix), and nutrition tracking to ensure a holistic approach to well-being. Additionally, the platform incorporates wearable device integration for real-time data synchronization and a social community for shared motivation and goal tracking.
